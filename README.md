# Open Referral UK API

Open Referral UK (ORUK) is an open data standard that provides a consistent way to publish and describe information. This makes it easier for people to find what they need and supports connected local services.

For more information about the Open Referral UK project please check out [openreferraluk.org](https://openreferraluk.org/)

## Overview

### Purpose

This solution provides a comprehensive validation service for Open Referral UK (ORUK) API implementations. It enables organizations to:

- **Validate OpenAPI Specifications**: Verify OpenAPI/Swagger specifications comply with ORUK and HSDS-UK standards
- **Test Live Endpoints**: Execute automated tests against live API endpoints to verify functionality
- **Schema Compliance**: Validate API responses against HSDS-UK (Human Services Data Specification UK) JSON schemas
- **Quality Analysis**: Assess API documentation quality, security configuration, and best practices adherence
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure endpoint response times and performance characteristics
- **Ensure Interoperability**: Help organizations build consistent, standards-compliant service directory APIs

### Key Features

- **OpenAPI Validation**: Validates OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) and 3.x specifications for structural correctness
- **Multi-version Schema Support**: Supports HSDS-UK v1.0 and v3.0 standards
- **Automated Endpoint Testing**: Tests all endpoints defined in OpenAPI specs against live APIs
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides quality metrics, security analysis, and actionable recommendations
- **Optional Endpoint Support**: Intelligently handles optional endpoints with configurable warning levels
- **Mock Data Service**: Built-in mock endpoints for testing validation logic
- **RESTful API**: Clean, well-documented API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Scheduled Feed Validation**: Background service for automated periodic validation of registered feeds
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting to protect against excessive requests
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes-ready liveness and readiness probes
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Distributed tracing and metrics for observability

## Technical Architecture

This solution is built as a modern, cloud-native application with the following components:

### Backend (ASP.NET Core API)

- **Framework**: .NET 10.0 with ASP.NET Core
- **Language**: C# 13+ with nullable reference types enabled
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI with XML documentation comments
- **Database**: MongoDB (optional) for storing service registrations and validation history
- **Validation Engine**: 
  - JSON Schema validation using Newtonsoft.Json.Schema (v4.0.1) and JsonSchema.Net (v8.0.5)
  - OpenAPI specification parsing and validation
  - Automated endpoint discovery and testing
  - Response schema validation against HSDS-UK standards
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration with OTLP export for metrics and distributed tracing
- **Health Checks**: ASP.NET Core Health Checks with MongoDB and external URL monitoring
- **Security**: Rate limiting, CORS configuration, configurable SSL validation

### Key Projects

- **OpenReferralApi**: Main ASP.NET Core Web API application
- **OpenReferralApi.Core**: Core business logic, models, and shared services
- **OpenReferralApi.Tests**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Core Services

- **OpenApiValidationService**: Orchestrates OpenAPI spec validation and endpoint testing
- **OpenApiDiscoveryService**: Discovers and parses OpenAPI specifications from URLs
- **JsonValidatorService**: Validates JSON responses against HSDS-UK schemas
- **JsonSchemaResolverService**: Loads and resolves JSON schema definitions
- **RequestProcessingService**: HTTP client management with caching and timeout handling
- **PathParsingService**: URL and path parameter parsing utilities
- **OpenApiToValidationResponseMapper**: Maps validation results to response formats
- **FeedValidationBackgroundService**: Schedules and executes automatic feed validation at midnight or fixed intervals

### Deployment

- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds with Linux-based images
- **Cloud Platform**: Heroku-ready with dynamic port configuration
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes-compatible health check endpoints
- **CORS**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing for frontend integration

### API Documentation

When running locally in development mode, interactive API documentation is available at:
- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:5000/` (or your configured port)
- **OpenAPI Spec**: `http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json`

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tpximpact/OpenReferralApi.git
   cd OpenReferralApi
   ```

2. **Run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Or run with .NET CLI**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet run --project OpenReferralApi/OpenReferralApi.csproj
   ```

4. **Access Swagger UI**: Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
